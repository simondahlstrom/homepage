# homepage

This is a project that will serve as my personal homepage. The idea is to use it as a portfolio website. I choose Vue.js for this project as I have wanted to learn it for a while now. This will be a learn while doing type of projects.

I started building this site with Vue.js and are planing to make it go through different phases. To begin with I'll make use of Vue.js, Vuex with it's store and all goodies it brings with state handeling. I will later build an ASP.Net Core backend for it in C#, from there the possibilities are endless.

With time this project will grow and switch technologies, and I can't wait to see what the future brings.
